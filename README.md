# antidote-selfmedicate

This is where you can set up a development environment for antidote
curriculum. 

Selfmedicate will be run inside a Vagrant environment so that it can run in a consistent, properly configured virtual machine with all of the dependencies needed.

If you want to create new lessons
or add to existing ones, this is what you will need to be able to preview your changes locally before opening a Pull Request.

It is **highly recommended** that you start by reading [the docs](https://antidoteproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
